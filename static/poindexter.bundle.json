The 1.8 beta was released a month ago and is finally stable, AFAWK. If we don’t receive any critical bug reports in the next week, it will be released as stable. After 1.8, the next goals are Routify 2 and Roxi, our new framework. To try the 1.8 beta, open your terminal and type: npx @roxi/routify init --branch beta Example of offline availability and prefetching of external assets \n   \n  \n  Both app and prefetched external data is available offline. PWA, offline availability Our 1.8 starter template comes with a service worker to cache all requests - local and external.\nAfter enabling the service worker (see how below), it will by default precache the entire app - excluding external assets - after the app has started. External assets are cached on request and considered fresh for 60 seconds. Beyond this duration, the stale cache is only used if the client or server is offline. To enable the service worker, uncomment it in App.svelte. The service worker can be configured in src/sw.js Service workers will only work on localhost and secure connections. To avoid stale data when developing, use a direct address like 127.0.0.1 or set up dev domain like dev.local in your hosts configuration. Service workers can be cleared in developer tools -> Application -> Clear storage. Prefetching The new prefetch helper lets you prefetch a page and all of its external assets. If you are using our service worker from the starter template, the request will be automatically cached. You can also configure your own caching strategies for external assets. Prefetching provides a better experience for visitors with unstable connections. It can also alleviate slow APIs. To prefetch a page and its external assets: <script>\n  import { prefetch } from '@roxi/routify'\n  prefetch('/prefetch/this/page')\n</script> Prefetch can also be used in elements with href tags: <a use:prefetch>Page with data</a> To cache the external assets for 24 hours: <a use:prefetch={{ validFor: 60 * 24 }}>Page with data</a>  Read more about prefetching here How to use prefetching - wip \nHow it works - wip Preloading Preloads pages, but unlike prefetching, it does not prefetch external assets. If you want to manually handle how your app is cached, disable precacheAndRoute(files) in the service worker and instead use the preload helper to cache the components you want cached in the order you want them cached. Preloading has no effect if the service worker is configured to cache the whole app. To preload specific pages in specific order: import { routes } from '@roxi/routify/tmp/routes'\nroutes\n  //routes consists of the internal API. We want the public one\n  .map(route => route.api)\n  // we only want to preload components with custom metadata\n  .filter(node => node.meta.preloadMePlz)\n  // let's import the most important components first\n  .sort((node, previousNode) => node.meta.myPriority - previousNode.meta.myPriority)\n  // let's preload\n  .forEach(node => node.preload()) Bundling This is an old pre-1,8 feature, but was only recently documented. By default pages and layouts are imported dynamically and individually. Bundling allows folders to be bundled into a single file to avoid request waterfalls. For more information, see our bundling page. Plugins Plugins expose the inner pipeline of Routify, which lets add, remove or replace middlewares. Plugins are still experimental. How to write a plugins - wip routify-plugin-frontmatter - The plugin that handles frontmatter on\nroutify.dev Nollup added to the Starter Template Nollup is short for not-rollup and provides much faster development rebuilds. Without Nollup, changes to the routify.dev website takes about 3s to rebuild. With Nollup rebuilds takes about 100ms. To use Nollup, run npm run dev:nollup. Note that Nollup does not work with SSR in development mode. If you need to test SSR, you can still run npm run dev or npm run build -> npm run serve.

It’s wolfr here. I am helping with Routify’s community. It’s been about two weeks since we released the 1.5 version of Routify. You can read all about that in our previous blog post here. Our release was met with a positive reception. We’ve had lots of people make the jump and give Routify a try, as evidenced by Github’s dependency graph which shows over 100 repos using Routify now. We’ve also gotten some excellent bug reports, with pull requests and ideas coming in. Open source as it should be! In this post I would like to summarize what happened. Here’s some highlights: The latest version of Routify is 1.6.4. You can check out all the releases here.Overall, several bugs have been fixed \nThe 1.6 release added a new feature: an afterPageLoad hook. \nLegionOfOne created a Routify starter that works with Firebase \nWe added a new generated navigation example. I also made a video that explains how to work with the generated navigation. \nJakob did a presentation at Svelte Society Day around Routify and its feature set. You can watch the presentation on YouTube. \nDocumentation on the site has been updated with Starter Template and Navigation both being added to the guide. There’s also some questions. The biggest question we get is how Routify compares to Sapper. The answer is a bit complicated, in the sense that it’s still being defined. On our Discord channel, we have been talking about a new project named Roxi. If you’d like to jump in on the conversation, make sure to check the #roxi channel.

This is not just the first blog post on Routify, but also my first ever blog post. Scary. For this cherry-popping first-post, we’re very happy to announce that 1.5 is finally ready. Among the highlights in this version are: Support for meta tags \nDynamic basepaths \nAutomatic navigation \nCLI enhancements \nQuery support \nImproved starter template Meta tags and Open Graph Set meta tags and Open Graph data directly from Routify, in a single line. For example this code… // import metatags\nimport { metatags } from \"@roxi/routify\";\n\n// set a metatag\n$: metatags.title = \"My app - home\"; will output the following: <title>My app - home</title>\n<meta name=\"title\" content=\"My app - home\" data-origin=\"routify\">\n<meta property=\"og:title\" content=\"My app - home\" data-origin=\"routify\"> That is all there is to it. Read more about meta tags Dynamic Basepaths Basepaths have been a long requested feature. Basepaths are strings but will be converted to RegExp’s internally. <script>\n  import { Router, basepath } from \"@roxi/routify\";\n  import { routes } from \"@roxi/routify/tmp/routes\";\n  $: $basepath = '/mybase'\n</script>\n\n<!-- src/App.svelte -->\n<Router {routes} /> To prerender a basepath add the basepath argument to your exporter.     npx routify export --basepath mybase Read more about basepaths Automatic Navigation with Layout and Page Helpers With the new layout and page helpers you can read a file’s metadata (not to be confused with metatags) or access its adjacent nodes. Here’s an example of creating automatic navigation with a layout helper: <script>\n  //let's import what we need\n  import { isActive, url, layout } from \"@roxi/routify\";\n</script>\n\n<ul>\n  <!-- iterate through each child of the current layout -->\n  {#each $layout.children as { path, title }}\n    <li class:active={$isActive(path)}>\n      <a href={$url(path)}>{title}</a>\n    </li>\n  {/each}\n</ul> You can also add extra links to the navigation by adding meta children to a layout. Here’s an example from this website’s root layout, where we add links to Github, Discord and Twitter. <!-- routify:options children=[\n  {\"title\": \"Github\", \"icon\":\"github\", \"path\": \"//github.com/sveltech/routify\"},\n  {\"title\": \"Discord\", \"icon\":\"discord\", \"path\": \"//discord.gg/ntKJD5B\"},\n  {\"title\": \"Twitter\", \"icon\":\"twitter\", \"path\": \"//twitter.com/routifyjs\"}\n] --> These metadata children can be accessed in $layout.children. Read more about Automatic Navigation CLI Enhancements The init command now accepts --branch --no-example --no-install and --start-dev. If you are already used to Routify, this way you can get a starter template with a minimal amount of files. $ npx @roxi/routify init --help\n  Usage: cli init [options]\n\n  Options:\n    -s, --start-dev      run \"npm run dev\" after install (default: false)\n    -e, --no-example     delete the example folder\n    -n, --no-install     don't auto install npm modules\n    -b, --branch [name]  branch to checkout (can also be commit hash or\n                        release tag) (default: \"master\")\n    -h, --help           display help for command Query Support $params now accepts query strings. $url('/blog/:id', {id: 123, theme: 'dark'} // blog/123?theme=dark\n\nconsole.log($params) // **{id: 123, theme: ‘dark’}** Improved Starter Template The starter template has received a lot of love and here are some of the improvements. Faster first build - Rollup and Routify are now run in parallel to improve performance on first dev build. \nSimplified scripts - We have updated  package.json and the scripts should be both simpler and more flexible. \nA unified __index.html -  No more __dynamic.html and __bundle.html. From here on there’s only one template to keep track of. \nNew Spassr server - We created our own server. It’s intended for development, but should also work in production.\nIn the Starter template it serves two versions of your app. SPA on port 5000 and SSR on 5005. $ npx spassr --help\n  Usage: cli [options]\n\n  Options:\n    -d, --debug              extra debugging\n    -h, --host [path]        host (default: \"localhost\")\n    -d, --dist-dir [path]    path to distributables (default: \"dist\")\n    -a, --app [path]         path from publish dir to app (default:\n                            \"build/bundle.js\")\n    -e, --entrypoint [path]  path from publish dir to entrypoint\n                            (default: \"__app.html\")\n    -b, --serve-spa          serve spa (default: false)\n    -s, --serve-ssr          serve SSR (default: false)\n    -B, --spa-port [port]    port serving spa app (default: 5000)\n    -S, --ssr-port [port]    port serving SSR app (default: 5005)\n    -h, --help               display help for command Netlify + Github integration - Go to your Netlify control panel and connect it to a Routify repo.

In short, our new hash based routing support required a breaking change - and when you have one breaking change, you might as well break everything. So we did. Gone are all the pet peeves. Path resolvement of $url was never quite right and as much as I hate to admit it, rixo was right from day one. From now on\n$url paths are resolved as traditional file paths and ./ refers to the folder and not the file. basepath was another pet peeve. It should have been an urlTransform function but by the time I realized, basepath had already been added. Almost lastly, _layout.svelte makes very little semantic sense. It handles guards, scopes, redirects, folder node etc. In short, the file represents the folder and folder-scope. Therefore a _folder.svelte alias has been added. Lastly, @sveltech was a pain to type so we moved everything to @roxi which just happens to be the home for our upcoming framework, Roxi 🤫 Getting Started To try the new Routify 2 beta, open a terminal and type npx @roxi/routify init --branch 2.x To migrate an existing project, refer to the migration guide below What’s new New package scope Routify has moved from @roxi/routify to @roxi/routify. This is both easier to type and aligns with our upcoming Routify-powered framework Roxi. Hash based routing Hash based routing has been on of the most requested features for Routify and now it’s finally here. To enable, set useHash to true in the runtime config. <Router config={{useHash: true}}> The runtime config is passed to the Router component, typically found in App.svelte New use directive for $url helper The $url helper can now be used as both a function and a use directive. /**function*/\n<a href={$url('./movies')}>Movies</a>\n\n/**directive*/\n<a href=\"./movies\" use:$url>Movies</a>\n\n/**function with parameters*/\n<a href={$url('./movies/:id', {id: 123})}>Some movie</a>\n\n/**directive with parameters*/\n<a href=\"./movies/:id\" use:$url={{id: 123}}>Some movie</a> urlTransform urlTransform replaces basepath.

Migration Guide Search and replace @roxi/routify with @roxi/routify \n$url() no longer treats non-layout files as folders. If you’re using relative paths replace the first ../ in $url() with ./. \n$basepath was deprecated in favor of urlTransform. Please refer to  urlTransform’s basepath example. \nThe Routify rollup plugin, now has to be imported from @roxi/routify/plugins/rollup \nroutifyDir has been defaulted to .routify.

Bundling a folder recursively <!-- routify:options bundle=true --> _layout.svelte of the folder to be bundled. What does it do? Bundling a folder compiles all pages and layouts in the folder recursively into a single .js file. Why fine-grained bundling? Request water falls -\nWhen you visit a page in Routify with dynamic imports, each layout and page is a separate file. This ensures that the client doesn’t have to wait for the entire app to load, just to visit a single page. However, there’s a point of diminishing returns, where the amount of requests outweighs the gains of serving smaller bundles. An excessive amount of requests is commonly referred to as a request waterfall. To solve this Routify provides the bundle meta option which lets you take control of how your app is bundled. Transitions - When using transitions you want the requested page to be available to avoid glitches as the page loads. This can be done by either A) bundling modules that contain page transitions or B) ensuring that requested pages are preloaded. Large files - can increase the bundle size significantly. If the file is rarely visited, it makes even more sense to exclude the file from a bundle with bundle=false. This is especially useful if you’re inlining large assets in your .svelte files. Can I bundle within a bundle? Yes. You can also disable bundling altogether for specific files and folders. Use case Imagine you have the following src/pages structure. .\n├─ products\n├─ blog\n├─ about\n└─ admin\n   └─ crud Your app is suffering from request waterfalls, but you do not wish to disable dynamic imports as that would require users to load the entire app, including the admin module. By enabling bundling in _layout.svelte and admin/_layout.svelte, we get two bundles: _-<hash>.js and _admin-<hash>.js. All pages and layouts are now contained within these two non-overlapping bundles. Live example Transitions on example app The transitions folder is bundled to avoid glitches from pages loading individually on page change. Opening the Network tab in your developer tools will show that no components are lazy loaded on page change.   \n\n Previous: navigation Next: Prefetching - wip \n\n  Writing good documentation that is up-to-date is difficult.

If you’re using the starter template, these features are enabled by default but can be disabled. Please note that these features are not mutually exclusive and you still get a fullfledged SPA when they’re enabled. What’s the difference between SSR and prerender/static export? SSR (Server-Side Rendering) is done in realtime and is useful for pages with dynamic content, like a news feed. Prerendering/static export is done when building the app. Prerendered pages are great for pages that don’t rely on APIs. Why do prerendered/SSR pages not contain data from my API? Pages are written to HTML when a page and its layouts have rendered. To wait for dynamic data, insert a $ready() at the end of your API request. For more information refer to our $ready() helper What’s the difference between prerendering and SSR? Prerendering happens when the site is built. SSR, or server-side rendering, is performed in realtime. Can prerendered pages have dynamic content? Yes and no. The saved HTML remains static, but once the app has loaded on the client, the dynamic content will be seamlessly updated. Can I have SSR without a server? Yes. SSR can be performed in serverless functions. Please refer to the script folder of the starter template for serverless functions. What is Roxi? Roxi is a framework, still in development. It will leverage Routify for routing as well as provide the same features as the starter template. How is Roxi different from Routify? Roxi handles the responsibilities which are currently assigned to the Routify Starter Template. This provides a much smoother upgrade path since the logic will be contained within Roxi and not the starter template. Can I join the team? Yes. We welcome all contributions and would appreciate additional core members. Especially documentation, examples, guides, art, templates, etc. can use an extra hand. Does Routify provide error handling Routify offers decorators. These are excellent for handling errors. Decorators are components which wrap around each individual descendant layout/page. <script> import {Boundary} from \"@crownframework/svelte-error-boundary\" </script>\n\n<slot decorator={Boundary} />   \n\n Previous: migrating from 1x Next: docs \n\n  Writing good documentation that is up-to-date is difficult.

In\n      fact, all navigation on this site is generated. Even hash links, external\n      links, and the previous/next buttons you see below. To create links for files in a folder, create a\n      _layout.svelte\n      in the folder and import the layout helper.  \n      <!-- _layout.svelte -->\n      <script>\n        import { isActive, url, layout } from \"@roxi/routify\";\n      </script>\n\n      <ul>\n        {#each $layout.children as { path, title }}\n          <li class:active={$isActive(path)}>\n              <a href={$url(path)}>{title}</a>\n          </li>\n        {/each}\n      </ul>\n       <!-- _layout.svelte -->\n<script>\n  import { isActive, url, layout } from \"@roxi/routify\";\n</script>\n\n<ul>\n  {#each $layout.children as { path, title }}\n    <li class:active={$isActive(path)}>\n        <a href={$url(path)}>{title}</a>\n    </li>\n  {/each}\n</ul>  Links are ordered by their file's index, which you can set with metadata.\n      <!-- routify:options index=3 -->\n      . To omit a file from navigation, set index to\n      false. External links and hash links can be added with the children metadata.  \n      <!-- routify:options children=[\n        {title: \"Github\", icon:\"github\", path: \"//github.com/sveltech/routify\"},\n        {title: \"Discord\", icon:\"discord\", path: \"//discord.gg/ntKJD5B\"},\n        {title: \"Twitter\", icon:\"twitter\", path: \"//twitter.com/routifyjs\"}\n      ] -->\n     <!-- routify:options children=[\n  {title: \"Github\", icon:\"github\", path: \"//github.com/sveltech/routify\"},\n  {title: \"Discord\", icon:\"discord\", path: \"//discord.gg/ntKJD5B\"},\n  {title: \"Twitter\", icon:\"twitter\", path: \"//twitter.com/routifyjs\"}\n] -->  <a> default Navigation If you want to use anchor's default navigation behaviour you can do so by adding the\n      target attribute.

It does what it was designed to do and it does it perfectly. Routify is a frontend router with an optional starter template. The starter template provides features like SSR and 1-click deployments. While they share the same file mapping convention, they approach most challenges differently.  SSR SSR compiles javascript to HTML, which can be served directly to the client or saved to a local HTML file (static export). Since it is not possible for a server to know which async calls to wait for, it doesn’t wait for any. Sapper and Routify both provide ways to handle this. Sapper uses Svelte’s built in SSR, which is faster, but restricted to node code/libraries. Routify uses JSDOM. Example client call <script>\n  let article\n\n  fetch('example.com')\n    .then(res => res.json())\n    .then(res => (article = res.html))\n</script> The above call works on the client, but during SSR the page would be rendered before the async call was resolved. In other words, the article would be missing. SSR handling in Routify In Routify this can be handled with a single addition: Call $ready() at the end of the async call. <script>\n  import { ready } from '@roxi/routify'\n  let article\n\n  fetch('example.com')\n    .then(res => res.json())\n    .then(res => (article = res.html))\n    .then($ready)\n</script> SSR handling in Sapper For Sapper you have four requirements: Replace browser functions with node compatible functions, like this.fetch. \nRun the async code inside a preload function. \nRun the preload function in a separate script with context set to module. \nReturn the fetched data to the primary script. <script context=\"module\">\n\texport function preload(page, session) {\n      const promise = this.fetch(`blog/${slug}.json`)\n        .then(res => res.json())\n        .then(res => res.article)\n      return { article: promise };\n\t}\n</script>\n<script>\n\texport let article;\n</script>  Parameters and Queries Routify’s parameters are inspired by Sapper, hence both use the [param].svelte convention. There are however a few differences in capability and implementation. Reactive parameters Routify’s parameters are reactive. Sappers aren’t. (TODO - Is this correct?) Multiple parameters Sapper allows multiple parameters in a single bracket: blog/[...slug].svelte. Routify doesn’t. Overloading parameters Routify allows overloading parameters: $url('/blog/:slug', {slug: 'first-post', theme: 'dark', page: 2})\n// /blog/first-post?theme=dark&page2 Accessing parameters Routify uses $params to access parameters. import { params } from '@roxi/routify'\n\n$: console.log($params) // { slug: \"first-post\", theme: \"dark\", page: \"2\"} Sapper uses preload to access parameters. <script context=\"module\">\n  export async function preload({params, query}, session) {\n    return {...params, ...query}\n  }\n</script>\n<script>\n  export let slug\n  export let theme\n  export let page\n</script>  Hosting and deployment Not requing a Node backend allows Routify to be “one-click” deployed to free tier services like Vercel and Netlify - while still providing features like static exports and SSR. Sapper has static exports, which lets your export your app as HTML files, which can then be deployed to the same services.  Prefetching Sapper uses <a rel=prefetch ... data for prefetching unvisited pages. Pages are prefetched on hover. Routify uses the prefetch helper which can be used programmatically or added to a link: <a use:prefetch .... Routify by default prefetches when the prefetch is called. Routify’s prefetch also caches assets like images.  Unique Routify features SPA Routify builds SPAs. SSR is handled by servers/serverless functions. Metadata Routify allows files to contain metadata: <!-- routify:options my-meta-data=\"Hello world\" --> Metadata allows custom or Routify specific data to be attached to a page. This data is available without having to load the page and can be used for built-in/custom logic. Tree/nodes and link generation Routify provides access to nodes, which can be used to access metadata and/or generating links: <script>\n  import { layout } from '@roxi/routify'\n</script>\n\n{#each $layout.children as node}\n  <a href={node.path} >{node.title}</a>\n{/each} Bundle management Routify let’s you bundle individual folders recursively to reduce request waterfalls. <!-- routify:options bundle=true --> Decorators Routify provides decorators, which are components that wrap around every descendending node: <script>\n  import MyDecorator from './_MyDecorator.svelte'\n</script>\n\n<slot decorator={MyDecorator} /> Every descending layout or page will be wrapped in MyDecorator.  Unique Sapper features Backend & server routes Sapper comes bundled with its own backend. rel=external Sapper requires rel=external on outgoing links. Tests Sapper comes bundled with Cypress for tests.

External assets are automatically cached when requested. External assets can be precached in advance by prefetching their respective page(s). External assets To tweak caching of external assets, parameters can be passed fetch('//myapi.com/data', { 'x-routify-valid-for': 3600}) Options are written as kebab-case and prefixed with x-routify-.

Mainly for debugging. \npreserveHeaders*: boolean Leave Routify headers on outgoing requests. \nPrefetch-only options: \ngracePeriod: number milliseconds to wait before fetching the next page in the queue \ntimeout: number milliseconds to wait before killing hanging fetch **Not yet implemented* How it works Caching of app components Caching is handled by the service worker found in src/sw.js. By default, all app components are fully cached in the background after the app has loaded. Caching can also be handled programmatically in the app by disabling precacheAndRoute(files) in the service worker. To programmatically cache a file call $layout.load. Routify then dynamically imports the component. This import generates a request which is then intercepted by the service worker which caches the response. Caching of external files When prefetch is called, the requested URL is rewritten from /original/path to /__app.html?__routify_path=/original/path&...[prefetching options] and then opened in a hidden iframe. This ensures that we use the SPA entrypoint file which is already present in the app. The requests made on this page are intercepted by the service worker which caches the responses. Once the network is idle and the gracePeriod has expired, the iframe is closed. Since all instances of the same app share the same serviceworker, all cached responses are available in the main app. Examples Caching all siblings of a layout or page $layout.parent.children.forEach(sibling => sibling.load()) Precaching files based on custom metatags <script>\n  import { Router } from \"@roxi/routify\";\n  import { routes } from \"@roxi/routify/tmp/routes\";\n\n\troutes\n    .filter(route => route.api.meta.precacheMePlz === true)\n    .forEach(route => route.api.load())\n</script>\n\n<!-- src/App.svelte -->\n<Router {routes} /> Live example https://example.routify.dev/example When visiting the API page, the individual tv-show pages are prefetched in the background. This means that all TV-show pages are instantly available, even if the network connection is lost before clicking a show.

The SPA is\n          then built in the client's browser. \n      SSR (Server Side Rendering)* -\n          the server prerenders the corresponding HTML and sends it to the\n          client. \n      SSG (Static Site Generation)* -\n          the server sends the corresponding pregenerated HTML file to the\n          client. \n    \n    * Along with the static HTML, your SPA is bundled and sent to the client.\n      Once the SPA is received, it handles all subsequent navigation. From this\n      point, the server only serves assets. \n\n  SSR vs SSG \n    SSR handles dynamic content as HTML is rendered in realtime. \n      SSG is faster as all HTML is prerendered. \n\n  Benefits vs SPA only \n    The first visit shows a rendered page without having to wait for\n        javascript to load. \n      Better SEO - search engines can crawl your page. \n      External references to your site become rich objects when using Open\n        Graph. \n\n  Highlights \n    Serverless. \n      Optional and enabled by default. \n      SSR and SPA use the same code.
