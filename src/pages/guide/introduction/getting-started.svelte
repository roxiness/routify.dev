      The easiest way to try Routify is to visit our
      <a
        href="https://codesandbox.io/s/github/sveltech/routify-example-tvshow/tree/6-navigation">
        TV Shows app
      </a>
      on Codesandbox. If you feel like playing with the code, you just click the
      fork button.

      The TV Shows app has a few steps
      <a
        href="https://github.com/roxiness/routify-example-tvshow/branches/all">
        (branches)
      </a>
      - each of which can be imported, using Codesandbox's "Import from Github"
      feature. In fact, any Routify project can be imported to Codesandbox.

  <h3 class="h3">Installation</h3>
    <p>
      Installing Routify locally is straight forward. We strongly recommend
      creating a new project with our CLI. It comes with "batteries included" to
      help you put your app into production much faster.
